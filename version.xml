  <changelog>
* Compiled with Java 9
* Changed Switch behavior because it was equal to DipSwitch with 1 switch
	(Now it's like a controlled buffer and it won't give retro-compatibility problems because it will be replaced with a DipSwitch if used in old files)
* Added Sel on register and changed PLA ROM enable to Sel pin
* Added Sel Level attribute on ROM, RAM, register and PLA ROM
* Added checkbox in Preference -> Fork to choose if fill component's background or keep it transparent
* Fixed again Analyze Circuit logic and added horizontal scroll bar in table if needed
* F1 key will open Library Reference
* Anti-aliasing and Fill Background in Preference will repaint all when clicked
* Graphical changes
* Maybe fixed some "blue wire" error
